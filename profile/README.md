[Artela](https://artela.network/) is an extensible L1 blockchain with [parallel execution](https://docs.artela.network/main/Artela-Blockchain/EVM++) and [interoperable VMs](https://docs.artela.network/main/Aspect-Programming), supporting the development of modular, customizable, and high-performance dApps. 

Artela's vision is to unlock the extensibility and scalability of EVM blockchains through the [EVM++](https://docs.artela.network/main/Artela-Blockchain/EVM++) paradigm, creating a new decentralized application runtime environment that accelerates the integration of innovative technology scenarios into the crypto world.

**üåü What are we building**

Artela is built upon a popular tech stack: [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), [EVM (Geth)](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime), [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc), and [Rollkit](https://github.com/rollkit/rollkit)

Building on these foundations, Artela continues to develop [EVM++](https://docs.artela.network/main/Artela-Blockchain/EVM++), a high-performance, highly extensible modular execution layer that supports parallel execution and interoperable VMs.



**üöß We provide long-term maintenance for:**

* [Arteal L1](https://artela.network/): Artela's main network, an EVM++ Layer 1 network.
* [EVM on Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/artela-network/artela): A continuously integrated EVM codebase that includes the latest updates to Cosmos SDK / IBC / EVM (Geth). If you wish to build an EVM-compatible chain based on Cosmos SDK like Artela, this is a viable option.
* [EVM Rollkit](https://github.com/artela-network/artela-rollkit): EVM on Rollkit, a continuously integrated Rollkit EVM codebase that includes the latest updates to Rollkit / Cosmos SDK / IBC / EVM (Geth). If you want to build an EVM-compatible chain based on Cosmos SDK like Artela, this is also a viable choice.


**üîç We are engaged in long-term research and exploration of:**

* **High-performance EVM execution layers**, covering technologies like parallel execution and parallel storage.
* Launching high-performance EVMs in the modular/Cosmos/Celestia ecosystem.
