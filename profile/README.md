[Artela](https://artela.network/) is an extensible L1 blockchain with [parallel execution](https://docs.artela.network/main/Artela-Blockchain/EVM++) and [interoperable VMs](https://docs.artela.network/main/Aspect-Programming), supporting the development of modular, customizable, and high-performance dApps. 

Artela's vision is to unlock the extensibility and scalability of EVM blockchains through the [EVM++](https://docs.artela.network/main/Artela-Blockchain/EVM++) paradigm, creating a new decentralized application runtime environment that accelerates the integration of innovative technology scenarios such as AI, AW/FOCG, Security DeFi, into the crypto world.
